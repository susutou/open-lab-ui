**open-lab-ui** is a set of files for the UI of my recent project **open-lab**. It is based on [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), and contains several HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.

These UI files are used to implement several specific interfaces, including:

- The main interface (index.html)
