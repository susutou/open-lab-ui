# Overview

**open-lab-ui** is a set of files for the UI of my recent project **open-lab**.
It is based on [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), and contains several HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.

# Components

These UI files are used to implement several specific interfaces, including:

- The main interface (index.html)
- The interface of projects list display (project-list.html)
- The interface for single project display (project-page.html)
